# Tire-Condition-Classifier-VGG16

Overview

This project focuses on developing an AI-powered binary image classifier to categorize tire images into two condition categories using VGG16 with PyTorch. By leveraging data augmentation, hyperparameter tuning, and regularization, the model achieves high predictive reliability, with a test accuracy of 98.12%. Additionally, the project extends into a business application, proposing an AI-driven mobile app that enables consumers to self-diagnose tire conditions, enhancing safety and user engagement.

Project Workflow
1. Image Upload:
   Used API to retrive the image dataset from Kaggle.
2. Model Development:
   Utilized the VGG16 model in PyTorch to build a binary classifier for tire condition categorization.
   Implemented data augmentation techniques to enhance model robustness by increasing the diversity of training samples.
3. Model Optimization & Performance Tuning:
   Hyperparameter tuning (learning rate, batch size, optimizer selection) to maximize performance.
   Applied regularization techniques (dropout, weight decay) to prevent overfitting.
   Achieved a test accuracy of 98.12%, ensuring high model reliability.
4. Business Application Proposal:
   Designed a data-driven business solution for a tire company by proposing an AI-powered mobile app.
   The app allows users to self-diagnose tire conditions by uploading images, improving road safety and user engagement.
